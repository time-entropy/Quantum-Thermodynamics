The quantum thermodynamics proposed in this framework refers to:

In this cosmo-model, since quantum thermodynamics is mentioned, the background is not a continuous field but a quantized network. Under this quantized network and at the Planck time scale, quantum thermodynamics is no longer statistical but analytical in nature. 

This study establishes an analytic quantum thermodynamic framework grounded in a discrete elastic spacetime model, where time emerges from a dynamic network of Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ) â€”Planck-scale units interconnected via spring-like bonds (1) Time-entropy mapping: Global time arises from irreversible entropy increase driven by discrete SEQ state transitions, quantified through multiplicative energy distributions--computable entropy value for each space transformation matrix, thereby unifying thermodynamic and quantum arrows of time. (2) Mass-gravity duality: Local compression of the SEQ network by SU(3) color forces stores energy as spatial strain (mass), while inducing divergent external stretching (gravity); the Higgs field stabilizes this compression via chiral "quantum lock" symmetry breaking, analogous to a preloaded torsional spring with ratchet (3) QCD-Higgs synergy: Nonlinear elasticity of SEQ networks under SU(3) explains quark confinement and asymptotic freedom, while Higgs coupling locks elastic energy storage, bridging strong interaction and gravitational physics. (4) Testable predictions: The model requires positron-electron magnetic moment asymmetry due to their opposite chiral coupling to SEQ spin ground states with fixed chirality, currently under experimental precision. This framework resolves black hole singularities (via SEQ tension up-limit), and bridges Quantum Thermodynamics, General Relativity, and Quantum Field Theory on a shared stage of quantized space network.
